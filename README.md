# CS Hud Observer :video_camera:

CS Hud Observer is stream overlay for CS 1.6 
Basic idea behind this stream overlay is to show currently non existing game status to stream watcher.


## Idea

Using game server stream events over socket (TCP/ UDP) to local streamer who will run this software which will display data to stream watchers.

## Unluko things

CS 1.6 game server doesnt have native event stream like CSGO, so everything needs to be recreated in AmxModX.
